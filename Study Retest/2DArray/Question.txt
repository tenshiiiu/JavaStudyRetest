//This method aims to obtain the largest number for each column in a 2D array
//and store these largest numbers in a seperate array

//The method accepts a 2D array for which the largest numbers of columns are to be found
//It uses nested loops to iterate through each column of the array, comparing numbers 
//to determine the largest number for each column
//It returns a 1D array containing the largest numbers for each column
